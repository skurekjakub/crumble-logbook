/**
 * Serves the data API: opens (and migrates) `config.dbPath`, builds the app
 * over it and listens on `config.port`, logging the URL once listening. When
 * the database file doesn't exist yet, it is created and seeded from
 * `config.snapshotPath` first. When it does exist, it is compared with the
 * snapshot, and a warning naming what differs and the fix is logged when
 * they differ; the database is never reseeded or deleted here, since after
 * an import it is the source of truth until exported. Run via `pnpm dev`
 * (with the web app), `pnpm dev:server` (watch mode) or
 * `pnpm --filter @crumble/server start`. Exits with the underlying error if
 * the database can't be opened, the snapshot can't be restored, or the port
 * is taken.
