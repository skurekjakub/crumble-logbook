/**
 * Writes the Vercel deployment to `.vercel/output` at the repo root, in
 * Vercel's Build Output API layout: the built web app (`apps/web/dist`, so
 * run `vite build` first) as static files that fall back to `index.html`,
 * and `src/vercel.ts` bundled as the function every `/api` request reaches.
 * Run via `pnpm build:vercel`, which builds the web app first.
 *
 * The bundle keeps `import.meta.url`, from which `@crumble/schema/migrations`
 * resolves `../migrations`, so the bundle sits in the function's `src/` and
 * the migrations are copied to its `migrations/`.
 *
 * Exits with the underlying error if the web app isn't built or the bundle
 * fails.
